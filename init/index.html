  To get started create a new group on group me. It can be named anything you want, but <strong>>I STRONGLY SUGGEST YOU DO NOT ADD ANYONE ELSE TO THIS GROUP.</strong> You will be using this to configure your shiny new bot!

  After your group is created navigate to dev.groupme.com. Create a new bot in the group you just made. The avatar can be any image you want or leave it blank and set the callback url to: $$callbackurl$$

  Copy the BOT ID from that page and paste it into this box. Then click save.

  After you've saved your bot ID go back to your group in groupme and type /init to continue your setup. Enjoy!
